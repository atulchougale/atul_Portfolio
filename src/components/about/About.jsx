          Hello, I'm Atul Shahaji Chougale, a full-stack developer looking for better opportunity to enhance my skills and knowledge.

            </p>
          <p>
          I realized that my true passion lay in software development, which led me to pursue a career in the technology industry. I completed a six-month internship at Arogo Plus, where I worked as a full-stack developer. During my time there, I gained experience working with technologies such as HTML , CSS , Javascript ,React js, mongodb,Node js , express js ,Bootstrap , tailwind css .

          </p>
          <p>

          I am always eager to learn new technologies and explore myself in this industry. As a full-stack developer, I'm excited to continue building innovative software solutions that make a difference in people's lives.          </p>
          <p>
          I am so confident now that I can work independently as a full stack developer and build the application on my own using the aboveÂ technologies.
